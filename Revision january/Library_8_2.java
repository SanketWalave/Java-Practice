/*4. Library Abstract Class
Problem: Create an abstract class Library that contains:
addBook(Book book) — adds a book to the library.
removeBook(String title) — removes a book based on the title.
Then, create two subclasses:
PublicLibrary — allows only public books to be added (books available to all).
PrivateLibrary — allows only private books to be added (books available to specific users).
Write a program that adds and removes books from both types of libraries and shows the current library list.
Explanation:
The abstract class Library contains the basic operations for adding and removing books.
Subclasses implement additional restrictions on the type of books that can be added.
Logical operation: Use abstraction to define the behavior of libraries, and the subclasses handle specific implementation details.
